                <div className='popculture-description'>Changemakers. It’s not easy being gen - next. Too often, young people are not taken seriously when they could be advocates of the new millennium. Often the solutions to our most difficult and complex challenges are likely to come from creative, idealistic, ambitious and energetic young people. We’re finding the changemakers of tomorrow and showcasing young achievers around the globe because it’s their time now.

                <div className='popculture-description'>
                Challenges. For a host of reasons, young people have been led to believe they are in some way incapable and unprepared to inherit the earth. Perhaps it’s a function of the country they are born in and its culture, or even media and ingrained social conditioning. In truth, climate change, social inequality, gender discrimination are legacies of previous generations. We believe that gen- next has the potential to tackle the challenges with innovation, creativity, determination and new ideas that will shape a better future.

                <div className='popculture-description'>
                This very minute. As we speak, there are countless young people from around the world demonstrating these traits. From girls risking their lives to learn, to teenage survivors of gun violence lobbying to change the law, to an entire generation of school students mobilising a strike for action on climate change, these are the young people creating a Change4Good. It is their stories that we want to share with the world.

                <div className='popculture-description'>
                Centre-­stage. We believe that showcasing young owners of the future will create a new breed of 
pro - active heirs to the world. We’re spearheading an initiative called SDGx. A solutions - oriented series of workshops, breakout sessions and visionary talks, debates and bold analyses, SDGx will spotlight impact - oriented projects, challenges, and strategies aligned to the SDGs. The focus would be on unusual, cross - sector collaborations, marrying private and public sector expertise and funding, to scale up and accelerate social impact enterprises led by the Global South Youth.

                Next-gen leadership. We’re in search of the next generation of trailblazers committed to steering the change we want to see in this world – through our soon to be launched Global Shakers index and portal profiling young changemakers. We want rule breakers. Problem solvers. Rebels with a cause. Champions of The World We Want.
